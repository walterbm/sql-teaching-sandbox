# Cardozo Coding SQL

## Objectives

SQL sandbox created to teach the basics of SQL to law students as part of the Cardozo Coding Class. 

The sandbox creates locally-stored SQLite databases which students can manipulate freely without the need for a server or the fear of damaging the data. Students can either create their own database or load any of the example databases. Features a small SQL code-editor with syntax highlighting and basic error detection.
